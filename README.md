## What is a Design Pattern?

A design pattern is an an abstract solution to solving a problem when it comes to software design.

Patterns normally consist of four things:

  1. **Pattern Name**

      Patterns need names in order to communicate solutions to an issue by only using one or two words.  We give a design pattern a name to make it easier to communicate to our colleagues, in documentation, and especially to ourselves when designing software.

  1. **Problem**

      Every design pattern has a specific use case.  The problem provides the context.

  1. **Solution**

      The solution to the problem isn't always concrete.  Since all implementations are different from one another, a design pattern is a template to provide a solution.  An abstract way of solving your problem.

  1. **Consequences**

      This is where the experience of a developer really comes into play.  Its a bit difficult to hand a developer a book about 23 design patterns and have them pick the ones that work to implement a good design.  Software gets rewritten often due to the tradeoffs from using different design patterns.  There is always things to take into account like space and time complexity, impact on the system, the choice is yours to choose the design pattern for your specific use case.
